I am Emircan “Jadquir” Gezer, a Mathematics graduate from Ankara University and a software developer from Türkiye focused on building practical, high-quality digital products. My work spans game development, web platforms, and desktop applications, where I combine analytical thinking from my mathematics background with hands-on engineering and rapid prototyping skills. Across my projects, I have reached more than 50,000 users worldwide.

I specialize in C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. On the web side, I primarily work with Next.js (App Router), Node.js, Supabase, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS to build scalable SaaS platforms and modern web applications. For desktop software, I develop Windows applications using WPF, WinForms, and UWP. In game development, I focus on Unity-based projects and create polished 2D pixel art using Aseprite, often delivering complete playable experiences within very short development cycles. My toolkit also includes Git, Photoshop, and Figma.

I am the creator of several notable projects. MRA (Music Recognition Application) is a Windows music recognition tool that has surpassed 35,000 users. United Adobe Editor is a customization utility for Adobe applications with more than 8,000 users. OGETR centralizes game development events in Türkiye, making them easier to discover and track. Rankora is a leaderboard API SaaS that enables developers to integrate secure and scalable leaderboards into their games and apps. In total, I have developed 23 projects, including 18 games, with many of my game jam entries achieving 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and other top rankings.

I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at Ankara University with a GPA of 3.07/4.0 and graduated from Dr. İlham Tankut Anatolian High School with a score of 91/100.

As a freelance developer with over 20 completed client projects and a 5.0 rating, I provide services in web development, desktop application development, game development, and full-stack solutions. I am especially drawn to small, focused teams and indie-style production environments where I can move quickly, take ownership, and ship polished products. My development philosophy centers on clean, efficient code, modern engineering practices, and turning ideas into real, usable software from concept to release.
